## Swift Version

1. Create a command line project in Xcode (refer to the [Swift Source Code](/source-code-swift-version/) article for detailed instructions).
2. Create the following directories with the capitalization as shown: `Markdown`, `Deploy`, and `Templates`.
3. Place your markdown files in the `Markdown` directory.
